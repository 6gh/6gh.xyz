        <h2 class="font-bold text-xl my-4">1. Uploading my MIDIs</h2>
        <p class="text-lg">
            You may upload my MIDIs to any platform, as long as you give the authors proper credit.
            Proper credit consists of linking the original video made by me in the description or
            something similar.
        </p>
        <h2 class="font-bold text-xl my-4">2. Download Links</h2>
        <p class="text-lg">
            If you will provide a download link to someone or in a video, you must either give the
            link to the MIDI's page or the direct download link obtained from the MIDI's page. You
            are not allowed to create your own download link by uploading the MIDI file to your own
            website or something similar. All links must be the true original link, for the reason
            that I may change the download link in the future, or privitize the MIDI.
        </p>
        <h2 class="font-bold text-xl my-4">3. MIDIs that have gone private</h2>
        <p class="text-lg">
            In the case that a MIDI has gone private, the download link will be removed from the
            MIDI's page. There will be no notice given to anyone who has downloaded the MIDI. If you
            have a MIDI that is now private, you may continue to use it for your own personal use.
            You will then be required to follow the <a class="link underline" href="#private-midis"
                >guidelines and rules for private MIDIs</a
            > from that point on.

        <h2 class="font-bold text-xl my-4">1. Uploading my MIDIs</h2>
        <p class="text-lg">
            Please contact me if you would like to upload my private MIDIs to a platform. Uploading
            a private MIDI without my permission will result in you being banned from getting my
            future private MIDIs.
        </p>
        <h2 class="font-bold text-xl my-4">2. Download Links</h2>
        <p class="text-lg">
            Download links for private MIDIs are not allowed to be shared. If you would like to get
            a private MIDI, please contact me. Do not get it from someone else.
        </p>
        <h2 class="font-bold text-xl my-4">3. General Rules of Thumb</h2>
        <p class="text-lg">
            If you are unsure if you are allowed to do something regarding a private MIDI, please
            contact me. I won't bite. I will be more than happy to answer any questions or concerns
            you may have.
        </p>

    <div class="mt-8">
        <h1 id="other-rules" class="font-bold underline text-4xl mb-4">III. Other Rules</h1>
        <h2 class="font-bold text-xl my-4">1. Modifications</h2>
        <p class="text-lg">
            You are allowed to modify my MIDIs, which includes editing the MIDI, remaking the MIDI,
            or remixing the MIDI. You are not allowed to claim the MIDI as your own. Proper credit
            must still be given to the authors. You are also not allowed to take away parts of the
            MIDIs and use them in a way that does not modify the original MIDI. For example, you are
            allowed to use it my MIDIs in remixes, but you are not allowed to take arts from said
            MIDI and use it in a different MIDI.
        </p>
        <h2 class="font-bold text-xl my-4">2. Begging</h2>
        <p class="text-lg">
            You are allowed to ask for a MIDI, but you are not allowed to beg for a MIDI. If you
            were rejected for a MIDI, please do not consistently ask for it. This is annoying and
            will result in you being banned from getting my future private MIDIs.
        </p>
        <h2 class="font-bold text-xl my-4">2. Exceptions</h2>
        <p class="text-lg">
            Exceptions exist for all rules. If you have a question or concern, please contact me.
            Most of the time I will make exceptions for certain things, or for certain people.
            Generally speaking, if you are a good person, I will be more than happy to make
            exceptions for you.
