      "hello guys! this is the 1k special midi i was working on and this version is the latest version I've made. i personally feel that even though it has a couple or more weaknesses, this is probably one of, if not, the best solo, original midis that ive made. ive spent like a month on it before I decided maybe its not good enough for 1k. but looking back on it I think I did a nice job and I don't think it was as bad as I thought while making this. tell me what you guys think! again, thank you all soooooo much for 1.1k subs, I am extremely grateful that you all decided to subscribe to me.  thank you ❤️",

      "On Nov 4th, 2018, I planned to create The Set Of Songs, another medley (primarily to replace CoBM, another medley that didn't turn out well). I uploaded three versions of TSOS and people started helping out. TSOS went through a lot of changes until it became TRR (TSOS Remastered Revamped) and it turned into an awesome medley. Almost 1 year and 4 months later, TRR was finished and here it is. Thanks LucasMIDI, Grimmy, JM, Andy, and ZBT so much for helping me out on this medley. (TSOS, TRR, and TSOS Remastered are all the same medley, just different versions)",
